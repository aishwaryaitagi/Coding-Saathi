            <p>
              Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, affectionately known as the "Missile Man of India," was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. He rose from humble beginnings to become one of India's most respected scientists, statesmen, and visionaries.
              Dr. Kalam's significant contributions to India's space and missile programs include leading the successful development of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Agni and Prithvi missiles.

His presidency focused on promoting education, particularly among the underprivileged, and encouraging youth to pursue science and innovation. He dedicated his post-presidential years to interacting with students and nurturing their dreams.
